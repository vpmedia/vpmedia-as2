* @ Created by: Robert Hoekman, Jr. (www.rhjr.net) & Interactive Alchemy (www.InteractiveAlchemy.com)
*
* @ PURPOSE: Used in conjunction with DebugIt Receiver (SWF). Creates a LocalConnection so you can
* trace data outside of the Flash authoring tool, while your application is running in its
* testing/production environment. Data is also traced to the Output panel, so you can use Debug.write()
* instead of trace() calls in all cases.
*
* @ USAGE: Instead of calling trace(), call Debug.write() and pass it as many parameters as you
* need (comma-delimited, of course). Each parameter displays on a new line in DebugIt Receiver.
